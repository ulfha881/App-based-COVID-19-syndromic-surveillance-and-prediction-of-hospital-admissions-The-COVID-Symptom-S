Codes and example data set for Covid Symptom Study Sweden

This folder contains all codes used for the paper "App-based COVID-19 syndromic surveillance and prediction of hospital admissions: The COVID Symptom Study Sweden". The codes can be run in order in Linux from the file "0_Run.sh". The original datasets can unfortunately not be attached due to the size and confidentiality issues, but example datasets are included in which the participant ID:s are changed, any free text variables removed and the location of the participant has been changed (the column is permuted). The code can be run using these example datasets. 
All codes needed for running the analyses are located in "/proj/sens2020559/COVID-19/Codes".
